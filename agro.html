              <p>
                The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times
                larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering. Agriculture began
                independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa,
                in at least 11 separate centres of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from
                at least 105,000 years ago. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200
                BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung, soy and
                azuki beans. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between
                10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea
                pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around
                9,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was
                independently domesticated in Eurasia. Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to
                explain the historical origins of agriculture.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Revolution</h3>
            <p>
              In the Middle Ages, both in the Islamic world and in Europe, agriculture transformed
              with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction
              of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees (such as the orange) to Europe by way of
              Al-Andalus. After 1492 the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize,
              potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as
              wheat, barley, rice and turnips, and livestock (including horses, cattle, sheep and
              goats) to the Americas. Irrigation, crop rotation, and fertilizers advanced from the
              17th century with the British Agricultural Revolution, allowing global population to
              rise significantly. Since 1900 agriculture in developed nations, and to a lesser
              extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization
              replaces human labor, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective
              breeding. The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer
              on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further
              increase in global population.Modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological,
              political, and economic issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically
              modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such
              as the organic movement.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Types</h3>
            <p>
              Pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals. In nomadic pastoralism, herds of
              livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This
              type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and
              some parts of India.
            </p>
            <p>
              In shifting cultivation, a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the
              trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil
              becomes too infertile, and the area is abandoned. Another patch of land is selected
              and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with
              abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in
              Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spreading manure by hand in Zambia Subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family
              or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively
              practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia. An estimated 2.5 billion subsistence
              farmers worked in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's arable land.
            </p>
            <p>
              Intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity, with a low fallow ratio and
              a high use of inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticide and automation). It is practiced
              mainly in developed countries.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Plant breeding</h3>
            <p>
              Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the
              beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the
              genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for
              humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to
              pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist
              Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially largely
              ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics
              and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection
              with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular
              techniques that genetically modify the organism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease
              resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional
              value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the
              characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s
              improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet
              induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s
              produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and
              barley.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic engineering</h3>
            <p>
              Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been
              altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA
              technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to
              utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional
              content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the
              attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food
              safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the
              production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the
              Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding
              the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO
              foods to be labeled, the US does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants
              to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer
              to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming
              the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the
              increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of
              glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have
              developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link
              widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop
              production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health
              implications.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Effects and costs</h3>
            <p>
              Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as
              pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff,
              excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of
              agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or
              £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that cropland
              imposes approximately $5 to $16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock
              production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal
              impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither
              included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the
              cost of agriculture to society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs
              such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as
              weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields
              larger; this means removing hedges, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides
              kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very
              low levels on intensively farmed land.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Livestock issues</h3>
            <p>
              A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that "Livestock are one of the most
              significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems". Livestock
              production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface
              of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for
              18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By
              comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of
              human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2,)
              and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO2.) It also
              generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor
              driving deforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now
              occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops. Through deforestation and
              land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore,
              the UNEP states that "methane emissions from global livestock are projected to
              increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns."
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Land and water issues</h3>
            <p>
              Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most
              substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving
              force in the loss of biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by
              humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem
              function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with
              cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving
              factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading
              land. Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral
              depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and salinization).
            </p>
            <p>
              Eutrophication, excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal bloom and
              anoxia, leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for
              drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to
              cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen
              and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major
              nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution
              of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations. Fertilisers also reduce
              terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favouring those species
              that are able to benefit from the added nutrients. Agriculture accounts for 70 percent
              of withdrawals of freshwater resources. Agriculture is a major draw on water from
              aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable
              rate.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Pesticides</h3>
            <p>
              Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million short tons annually worldwide,
              yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health
              Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually,
              causing 220,000 deaths. Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest
              population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest
              resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.
            </p>
            <p>
              An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine
              is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote
              heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more
              land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and
              a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic
              practices such as crop rotation. The Push–pull agricultural pest management technique
              involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to
              lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Climate change</h3>
            <p>
              Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. Global warming
              affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and weather
              extremes (like storms and heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in
              atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the
              nutritional quality of some foods; and changes in sea level. Global warming is already
              affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world. Future
              climate change will probably negatively affect crop production in low latitude
              countries, while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Global
              warming will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups,
              such as the poor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of CO 2 and a
              percentage of the world's methane, and future land infertility, and the displacement
              of wildlife. Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of
              greenhouse gases, and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for
              agricultural use. Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to
              25% to global annual emissions in 2010. A range of policies can reduce the risk of
              negative climate change impacts on agriculture, and greenhouse gas emissions from the
              agriculture sector.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
              Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels
              of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming
              using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and ecosystem resources
              are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value
              to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the
              rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures
              are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to
              rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the
              preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make
              farming more sustainable. Technology permits innovations like conservation tillage, a
              farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, reduces water pollution, and
              enhances carbon sequestration. Other potential practices include conservation
              agriculture, agroforestry, improved grazing, avoided grassland conversion, and
              biochar. Current mono-crop farming practices in the United States preclude widespread
              adoption of sustainable practices, such as 2-3 crop rotations that incorporate grass
              or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon
              sequestration become policy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Energy dependence</h3>
            <p>
              Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to
              the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The
              vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. Between the 1960s
              and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with
              world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and
              60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. Heavy
              reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs
              and reduce agricultural output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: direct
              consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption
              includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery.

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Systems</h3>
            <p>
              Traditionally, animal husbandry was part of the subsistence farmer's way of life,
              producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser,
              clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary
              consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood
              (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive.[22] In the
              traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between
              fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the
              mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.[23]
            </p>
            <p>
              Animals can be kept extensively or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals
              roaming at will, or under the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection
              from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle
              grazing widely over public and private lands.[24] Similar cattle stations are found in
              South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall.
              Ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca.[25]
            </p>
            <p>
              At the other extreme, in the more developed parts of the world, animals are often
              intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their
              forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots;[27] pigs may
              be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors;[28] poultry may be
              reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled
              conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family-run farms
              where livestock graze outside for much of the year, silage or hay is made to cover the
              times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed, and other inputs are
              brought onto the farm from outside.[29]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Feeding</h3>
            <p>
              Animals used as livestock are predominantly herbivorous, the main exceptions being the
              pig and the chicken which are omnivorous. The herbivores can be divided into
              "concentrate selectors" which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious
              young foliage, "grazers" which mainly feed on grass, and "intermediate feeders" which
              choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep,
              goats, deer and antelopes are ruminants; they digest food in two steps, chewing and
              swallowing in the normal way, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it
              again and thus extract the maximum possible food value.[30] The dietary needs of these
              animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow from the base of the leaf-blade,
              enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut.[31]
            </p>
            <p>
              Extensively reared animals may subsist entirely on forage, but more intensively kept
              livestock will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly
              derived from cereals and cereal by-products, fats and oils and sugar-rich foods, while
              protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods,
              often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction.[34] Pigs and poultry are
              non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they
              are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the
              animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, in the form of pelleted or
              cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of
              livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins
              and minerals are added to balance the diet.[35] Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted
              food.[35]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Breeding</h3>
            <p>
              The breeding of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers
              with a view to encouraging traits seen as desirable. These include hardiness,
              fertility, docility, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per
              unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, and better fibre qualities.
              Undesirable traits such as health defects and aggressiveness are selected
              against.[36][37]
            </p>

            <p>
              Selective breeding has been responsible for large increases in productivity. For
              example, in 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy
              as a bird of similar age in 1957,[36] while in the thirty years to 2007, the average
              milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.[36]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Animal health</h3>
            <p>
              Good husbandry, proper feeding, and hygiene are the main contributors to animal health
              on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite
              these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with veterinary
              medicines, by the farmer and the veterinarian. In the European Union, when farmers
              treat their own animals, they are required to follow the guidelines for treatment and
              to record the treatments given.[38] Animals are susceptible to a number of diseases
              and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever[39] and
              scrapie[40] are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth
              disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals.[41] Animals living under intensive
              conditions are prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea
              lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland.[42] Reducing the parasite burdens of
              livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.[43]
            </p>

            <p>
              overnments are concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals.
              Wild animal populations may harbour diseases that can affect domestic animals which
              may acquire them as a result of insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus
              in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with
              fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the
              infection to humans.[45] Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be
              carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to
              domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious
              diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies,
              leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.[46]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Range of species</h3>
            <p>
              There is no single universally agreed definition of which species are livestock.
              Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats,
              pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as
              horses,[47] while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In some parts of the world,
              livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the
              alpaca and llama.[48][49][50] Some authorities use much broader definitions to include
              fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and rodents like guinea pigs, as
              well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.[51]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Products</h3>
            <p>
              Animals are raised for a wide variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and
              eggs, but also including tallow, isinglass and rennet.[52][53] Animals are also kept
              for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines[54] and antiserum
              (containing antibodies) for medical use.[55] Where fodder or other crops are grown
              alongside animals, manure can serve as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic
              matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.[56]

            <p>
              Although all mammals produce milk to nourish their young, the cow is predominantly
              used throughout the world to produce milk and milk products for human consumption.
              Other animals used to a lesser extent for this purpose include sheep, goats, camels,
              buffaloes, yaks, reindeer, horses and donkeys.[57]
            </p>

            <p>
              All these animals have been domesticated over the centuries, being bred for such
              desirable characteristics as fecundity, productivity, docility and the ability to
              thrive under the prevailing conditions. Whereas in the past, cattle had multiple
              functions, modern dairy cow breeding has resulted in specialised Holstein
              Friesian-type animals that produce large quantities of milk economically. Artificial
              insemination is widely available to allow farmers to select for the particular traits
              that suit their circumstances.[58]
            </p>

            <p>
              Whereas in the past, cows were kept in small herds on family farms, grazing pastures
              and being fed hay in winter, nowadays there is a trend towards larger herds, more
              intensive systems, the feeding of silage and "zero grazing", a system where grass is
              cut and brought to the cow, which is housed year-round.[59] In many communities, milk
              production is only part of the purpose of keeping an animal which may also be used as
              a beast of burden or to draw a plough, or for the production of fibre, meat and
              leather, with the dung being used for fuel or for the improvement of soil fertility.
              Sheep and goats may be favoured for dairy production in climates and conditions that
              do not suit dairy cows.[57]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Meat</h3>
            <p>
              Meat, mainly from farmed animals, is a major source of dietary protein around the
              world, averaging about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on
              local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and
              goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring
              annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and
              these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing
              more than one litter of up to about 11[60] piglets each year.[61] Horses, donkeys,
              deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various
              regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity,
              hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency.
              About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on
              enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various
              factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared
              indoors, typically at high densities.[62]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Poultry</h3>
            <p>
              Poultry, kept for their eggs and for their meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and
              ducks. The great majority of laying birds used for egg production are chickens.
              Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as
              they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive
              systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of
              movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are
              arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg
              collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg
              production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable
              to exhibit their normal behaviours.[63]
            </p>

            <p>
              In the developed world, the majority of the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors
              in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions.
              Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant
              that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching.
              Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating.
              Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they
              grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The
              birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one
              time.[64]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Aquaculture</h3>
            <p>
              Aquaculture has been defined as "the farming of aquatic organisms including fish,
              molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants and implies some form of intervention in the
              rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection
              from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the
              stock being cultivated."[67] In practice it can take place in the sea or in
              freshwater, and be extensive or intensive. Whole bays, lakes or ponds may be devoted
              to aquaculture, or the farmed animal may be retained in cages (fish), artificial
              reefs, racks or strings (shellfish). Fish and prawns can be cultivated in rice
              paddies, either arriving naturally or being introduced, and both crops can be
              harvested together.[68]
            </p>

            <p>
              Fish hatcheries provide larval and juvenile fish, crustaceans and shellfish, for use
              in aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks
              and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in
              hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar
              facilities can be used to raise species with conservation needs to be released into
              the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at
              these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and
              nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage;
              farmers seek to minimise this while at the same time maximising growth rates.[69]
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Insects</h3>
            <p>
              Bees have been kept in hives since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt, five thousand
              years ago,[70] and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed
              comb hives are used in many parts of the world and are made from any locally available
              material.[71] In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have
              been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which
              enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart
              from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and
              wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist
              in pollination.[72]
            </p>

            <p>
              Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, was first adopted by the Chinese during the
              Shang dynasty.[73] The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth.
              When it spins its cocoon, each larva produces an exceedingly long, slender thread of
              silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is
              normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan
              however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are
              expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being
              used to rear the silkworms in Japan.[74]
            </p>

            <p>
              Insects form part of the human diet in many cultures.[75] In Thailand, crickets are
              farmed for this purpose in the north of the country, and palm weevil larvae in the
              south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on commercial pelleted
              poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees,
              which limits their production to areas where these trees grow.[76] Another delicacy of
              this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques
              in semi-natural habitats are being studied.[76]
